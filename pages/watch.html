					In the Parable of the Sower, Jesus illustrates examples of how a person has received the gospel of truth. Whether by being enticed by the world or having a faith led by turbulent emotions, we may find our struggle in discipleship is a matter of how well we listen to the voice of God. Then, for the word of God to take root in our hearts, we must assess if we have the ears to hear and eyes to see. The hope we find in Jesus’ teachings is that not only do we hope to flourish in truth, but wherever we might be in our faith, we never know what kind of fruit we might bear in the hands of the Gardener.

					When we look at the content of magazines, Instagram, and the various media platforms we have available to us today, it is evident that our society has grown accustomed to a cultural norm of lust. It goes to show that in the ubiquitous nature of lust surrounded by a lack of awareness regarding its implications, Sin has become hidden in plain sight. In the context of the #MeToo movement that is exposing the rampant sexual misconduct in our society, the teaching of Jesus challenges believers to see that just because everyone is doing it doesn’t mean it’s right.

					In the Parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector, Jesus highlights a two-part confrontation of how humanity deals with the reality of our sin and moral failings: the subtlety that lies in pride and the beauty of humility. The self-complimenting, fluffed up spirit that many of us carry indicates a grievous misunderstanding of who we are when we look down on “those that are incomparably immoral to how great we are,” when in reality, the Father rewards sincerity, not piety. The power of the Gospel and the story of Jesus is unleashed in the power of vulnerability, the beauty of humility, and a remembrance that there is no ambiguity that Jesus is the hero of the story, and our own.</p>

					“Love your neighbor as yourself,” is the great takeaway that many of us draw from the Parable of the Good Samaritan, but it begs the question, “who is my neighbor?” Many of us are caught in the insularity of our communities, relationships, ideologies, and beliefs that make it easy to attract like minded people, but when it comes to the people we disagree with and disapprove of, trying to love them can turn the depths of our stomachs. Though we can disagree with revelation, Christ’s call for us Christians is to uphold the dignity inherent in the sons and daughters made in the imago dei.
